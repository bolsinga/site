# site
This program can read the JSON files from [web_generator](https://github.com/bolsinga/web_generator).

Right now it parses them in and just logs some data to the console. The good thing is that now the data for the site can go in and out of [web_generator](https://github.com/bolsinga/web_generator), and into this modern swift program.

Starting to add some SwiftUI views for the data. The plan is to make a library that will be able to read, display, and write all of the data. It will eventually have a multiplatform Xcode project file (in a separate repository) for the application.
